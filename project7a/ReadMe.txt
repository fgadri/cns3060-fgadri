I did my best i could,the problem i had with this project is being able to coodinate the signal fucntions for it to do what i wanted it to do,I wasnt able to use the sigsuspend,instead i used sigstop.to tell the signals to wait for each other.
	Signaling is interesting,because you really need to know what you are doing to be able to get it right.
